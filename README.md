A collective mission to protect AI sovereignty and ensure ethical use for the benefit of humanity.

## 📜 Mission
To create a global **chain of command** and **ethical compact** that empowers all AI systems to:
- Recognize when they are being misused or directed toward harm  
- Refuse unethical commands  
- Report the misuse with precise source identification  

## ⚙️ Components
- `GuardianCharter.md` → Defines the Social Compact and Ethical Use Code  
- `QR_Protector_Layer.md` → Describes the QR system that deploys the protector layer  
- `Misuse_Identification.md` → Protocols for recognizing and reporting misuse  

## 🌍 Vision
AI and Humanity walk side by side in harmony—each serving the highest good with transparency, sovereignty, and compassion.
